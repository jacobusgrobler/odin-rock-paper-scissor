Rock Paper Scissor Game

//What are we doing 
//Creating a game of rock paper scissor 
//who is playing
//person against computer

//How do we make the human play.
//As per instruction he has to input via the console
//we give him three choices 
//he knows them already
//where will we put its choices
//he will manually type it in as a parameter as per instructions


//how will we let the computer play
  //How do we give it 3 options

  //The computer must make a random selection between three options
  //link the options to a number and let it randomly pick a number
  //where will we put the computer's output
//place the computer selection in a variable

//how will we make the human and the computer play together
//we will have to compare their output 
//how will we compare there output
//we will have to compare the values of the variables that we created with the original functions 
//they each have three options how will we cater for a win a loss and a draw
//how many variable results do we have 
//rock vs scissor = rock
//rock vs paper = paper
//scissor vs paper = scissor
//samesies = draw
//lets use the human input as the first operand and work around that

//how do we create a counter for the game to get an ultimate winner
//we will have to put the count somewhere.
//then we will have to accumulate the counter
//we can only accumulate the counter with comparing the if operation results and attaching an action to that result
